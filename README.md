Node js:

* Node js is a cross-platform runtime environment that allows us to create server-side and networking applications.
* Node.js apps are written in javascript and run on osX,Microsoft,windwos and linux.
* Node.js also comes with a large library of JavaScript modules, making it much easier to construct web applications with it. It enhances the functionalities of Node.js.
* NodeJs facilitates the integration of programming languages with APIs, other languages, and a variety of third-party libraries.
* Node js allows us to create API to provide data to the frontend.

Features of Node js:

1.Asynchronous and Event-Driven:  The Node.js library’s APIs are all asynchronous (non-blocking) in nature. A server built with Node.JS never waits for data from an API. from an API. After accessing an API, the server moves on to the next one. In order to receive and track responses of previous API requests, it uses a notification mechanism called Events.

2.Single-Threaded: Node.js employs a single-threaded architecture with event looping, making it very scalable. In contrast to typical servers, which create limited threads to process requests, the event mechanism allows the node.js server to reply in a non-blocking manner and makes it more scalable. When compared to traditional servers like Apache HTTP Server, Node.js uses a single-threaded program that can handle a considerably larger number of requests.

3.Scalable: NodeJs addresses one of the most pressing concerns in software development: scalability. Nowadays, most organizations demand scalable software. NodeJs can also handle concurrent requests efficiently. It has a cluster module that manages load balancing for all CPU cores that are active. 

4.Cross-platform compatibility: NodeJS may be used on a variety of systems, including Windows, Unix, Linux, Mac OS X, and mobile devices. It can be paired with the appropriate package to generate a self-sufficient executable.

5.Uses JavaScript: JavaScript is used by the Node.js library, which is another important aspect of Node.js from the engineer’s perspective. Most of the engineers are already familiar with JavaScript. As a result, a designer who is familiar with JavaScript will find that working with Node.js is much easier.
